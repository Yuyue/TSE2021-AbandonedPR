62,,,,,"i have made many contributions to many different projects.  my experience in open source is that you need have to merge requests as quickly and smoothly as possible in order to ensure that people will contribute more, even if the code quality/technicals are not as 'prefect' as desired.  people that try to enforce commercial/academic code review bureaucracy on their open source project will inevitably kill their project.    as such, i usually make small pull requests the first time to a project to see how quickly they accept them.  projects that take a two weeks or more to respond i consider to be dead and are not worth my time.  after a year i close old pull requests so they do not clutter things up.    my personal average over many years of coding is that for every commit i make that gets accepted, i make another commit that does not.  i long ago stopped getting emotionally involved in the process.  the easiest way to get to a thousand commits is to make two thousand."

This is a serious social issue (people puts actually effort, ultimately for nothing), however, I don't think much can be done about it, as it is very simply a reflection of the real-world nature of the maintainers.    If a maintaner is a somebody who in life deludes themselves that in the future they're going to perform a task, but never will, leaving a PR open is the same phenomenon translated in the digital life.    If a maintaner is a person who can't manage handling difficult subjects with other people, in digital life they'll leave PRs open because they're afraid to hurt other people.    Both problems can be handled, and it's not even difficult, but require consciousness. In myy opinion, a MAINTAINERS_CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md should be introduced, implying that maintaners also can act irresponsibly, not only contributors.

527,"Changes were much more complicated than anticipated and there was no clean way I could think of to solve the issue without really gross code. I would much rather take time to submit good code than a really weird workaround, especially if the feature/bugfix is not urgent or critical.",,It really depends on the circumstance but I am open to being as involved or out of it as needed/helpful.,,

533,,,,,Absent maintainers or lack of good responses from teams is the primary reason PRs get abondoned in my work.  In example trying to get responses from the general Fedora community is frequently like pulling teeth.  It has turned me off to working with them :\

Many PRs that I've submitted are still out there because no one has responded to them.    I think many people submit a pull request and then don't look at it again, or they don't see the GitHub notifications, or they don't want to go through the effort of a review process on their PR... again I try not to do this myself."
