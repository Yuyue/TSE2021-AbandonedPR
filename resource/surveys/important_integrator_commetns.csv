Participant,What is the impact of pull request abandonment?,How did you deal with the abandoned pull request?,Would you have negative impression on contributors who have abandoned their pull requests?,Anything else you would like to tell us about  the pull request abandonment?,
1,,,,My general feeling is that pull request abandonment is more a result of development friction with complex processes of the project than it is about the individual contributors themselves. Often times people just don't have the time to invest very heavily in working on something so processes need to be designed in a way to encourage landing quickly and smoothly and not having single-ownership responsibility that can result in features stagnating if the owner has to leave the project in the future. People change their career trajectory all the time so expecting individuals to own a bit of code forever is unrealistic.,

9,,,,,
10,,,,"In my experience, depending on how valuable the PR is, we end up either closing if it isn't that important (eg. a new feature) or fixing and merging the code ourselves if the project needs it (eg. a bug fix).",
11,"They cause well-meaning contributors to open up additional (and unwanted) PRs, cluttering the repo.",,"Depends on why. Depends on where the discussion led, what alternative PRs came about.","It happens for different reasons. Abandonement is perhaps too strong a term, sometimes it is just a matter of time that has not completed yet. Sometimes a PR leads to a discussion that reveals significant further development is needed, and not yet done.",

23,,I keep it open as the author might come back someday. We never know the reason why a PR was abandoned :(,,"Trying to figure out the reason why the PR was abandoned is the key. Maybe the reason that you have multiple PRs in that stage is that your review process is too hard, for example. Once you have that answer, you can work to reduce the turn around of PRs.",

47,Lost review time that could have been invested in reviewing other PRs and/or writing my own patches.,"we typically ping the original author of the PR, and close it if they don't respond within a reasonable period of time.","I generally don't have a negative impression of them unless it happens very frequently with the same person. Especially if it's a community driven by voluntary efforts, the author typically gave an honest attempt and abandoned their PR due to lack of time or a slow response from reviwers.",,

77,"It's not great, but it's not THAT big of a problem.",,,"For open source projects, if an outside contributor abandons a PR it's not that big of a deal. If the project is big enough and has enough momentum, someone else, sometimes me, will generally implement the feature/fix if it's important.    Also, having bots automate pedantry is great. Stalebot closes most of the stale PRs on my projects. It frees up my time, and people are less likely to complain or have their feelings hurt by a robot.",

80,"In the real world, the impact is quite low. Code review and issue triage is never wasted simply because a participant goes AWOL. If a PR is of real concern, someone else will pick it up and the effort carries over and does not need to be repeated."," It depends on the situation. All of these are valid options I've exercised in the past (except for ones that have nothing to do with me, like that one weird option), depending on the circumstances. ",,,
81,,,,Offering to pair can help; abandonment is often from lack of capability to execute on comments. ¨¹Drive by¨¹/prs where nobody speaks to a team member are often abandoned because they are so far from the direction the team wants to take.,
